They feature an easily repairable 3-piece design that lends itself well to track side repairs.,"Woodcraft Rearsets Aprilia RSV4 / Tuono V4 1100 Woodcraft designs and builds their rearsets based on three key areas: function, durability and ease of repair. First, the rearsets must function beyond all else. They must provide the adequate ground clearance and vital feedback that a fast rider needs to push his or her machine to the limit. Second, they must be able to take a beating and keep on going. These rearsets are machined from 6061-T6 billet aluminum, resulting in a rearset that is more than twice as durable as an OEM rearset. In the event of a crash, the fixed high-grip knurled footpegs act as a secondary frame slider to keep the swingarm and mid-frame off of the tarmac. Lastly, many Woodcraft Rearsets utilize a 3-piece design that provides ease of assembly and repair. The fewer parts there are, the less that can go wrong. Features: Standard and GP Shift High-grip knurl foot pegs or eccentric adjustable high-grip knurled footpegs High-grip knurl toe pegs or eccentric adjustable high-grip knurled toe pegs Hard Teflon-coated brake and shift pedal pivot ensures a super smooth action Includes all necessary mounting hardware Black or Clear anodized finish Optional Woodcraft Folding Toe Piece (sold separately) Optional Woodcraft Brake Light Switch available (sold separately) Note: Woodcraft Rearsets are designed for track use only."
